/*

All settings for Caret are stored in JSON-formatted files. If you open one of
these files from the menu, then save it, it'll be dropped into Chrome's
synchronized storage, which means that (theoretically) all your computers will
get a copy. Comments are allowed, obviously--they'll be stripped out on load.

Your individual settings are shallow-merged with a copy of the defaults 
(available from Settings > View Defaults). When you first open them, your
configuration will be a copy of the defaults, but I recommend stripping out
anything you don't want to set explicitly, so that you can benefit if the
default settings change in future releases.

If your local file is not valid JSON, the defaults will be used. If your changes
aren't being accepted, run the file (sans comments) through a JSON checker and
make sure you don't have any syntax errors.
